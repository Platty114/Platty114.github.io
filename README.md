# James Platt's personal Website!

This is a pretty simple project, consisting of only three files
- index.html
- style.css
- darkMode.js

The basic structure of the website of the wesbite can be found in index.html
and the styling/animations for the website can be found in style.css.

darkMode.js is used to swap the the classes for all elements from their light 
versions to their dark versions
