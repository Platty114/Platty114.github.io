			<h2 id="aboutMe">Hi, I'm James.</h2>
			<div class ="aboutMeFlex">
				<p >I was born and raised in Calgary Alberta, and I am currently a student at the University of Calgary, studying software Engineering. 
				This summer I wanted to spend some time learning new languages and experimenting with developing some apps. You can find some of my projects below!
				When I'm not learning new things or working, I like to spend my time learning Japanese, playing hockey and working out, working on my car, and playing around with linux.</p>

				<h3>ENSF409 Food Bank Database and Ordering system</h3>
				<p>This was a project I worked on during the winter 2022 semester for my Principles of Software Development class. I was put in a group with 3 of my classmates, and we were
				tasked with developing a Java based GUI application that was able to interact with an SQL database of items, take an order, and then find the ideal list of items for
				the order from items in the database. If there weren't enough items, it needed to report that to the user, and then report how many calories the database was short, broken down by specific macro nutrients.			
				I had my hand in almost every part of the project, from developing the GUI on my own, to managing the database, and develooping the main flow of the
				program. We recieved a perfect grade.

				<h3>Personal Website</h3>
				<p>At the end of summer 2022, I decided I wanted to put the little bit of HTML and CSS that I had learned over the summer to good use and make
					myself a personal website! It's built using HTML and CSS (so far, I hope to add JavaScript to it soon!) You can find all the code for it
					over on my personal github account here.</p>
