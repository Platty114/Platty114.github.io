I was put in a group with 3 of my classmates, and we were tasked with developing a Java based GUI application that was able to interact with an SQL database of items, take an order, and then find the ideal list of items for the order from items in the database. If there weren't enough items, it needed to report that to the user, and then report how many calories the database was short, broken down by specific macro nutrients. I had my hand in almost every part of the project, from developing the GUI on my own, to managing the database, and develooping the main flow of the program. ",
